Wed Jan 24

Things I can do:

- Create a course through admin interface.
- Enroll instructor using code.
- Add students manually to the course.
- Create an assignment with release date, due date. 
- Create a submission for an assignment

TODO: Check other places where course ID is referenced as cid rather than course_id.  (The reviews for course page does not display because it is checking cid in session but course ID is stored as course_id in session.)


Possible important bugs:
- Cannot seem to add assignment questions when creating an assignment.
- No option to assign reviews.
- Configure review sessions does not save it.
